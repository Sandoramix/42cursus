**Started in: `2023-10-09`**

Every cursus' project will have it's own branch.

This branch (`master`) is used only to share useful information between all of them.

### Utilities

I made some simple but yet useful scripts to speed up the workflow:

- `proToC.py`: convert every prototype inside a header file to it's own `.c` file with it's implemented function
- `getSrc.py`: get all filenames that end with `*_bonus.c` and `*.c` and create the list of `SRC` and `SRC_BONUS` for your Makefile
