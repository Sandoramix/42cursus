### Utilities

#### VSCode settings

I've rearranged some useful settings for making the user experience a little better on C projects in vscode.

All you need to do is to copy the [`.vscode`](.vscode) folder into your project.

#### Scripts
I made some simple but yet useful scripts to speed up the workflow:

- [`proToC.py`]("./utils/proToC.py"): convert every prototype inside a header file to it's own `.c` file with it's implemented function
- [`getSrc.py`]("./utils/getSrc.py"): get all filenames that end with `*_bonus.c` and `*.c` and create the list of `SRC` and `SRC_BONUS` for your Makefile
