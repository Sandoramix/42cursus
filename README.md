## üöÄ Utilities

### üìÅ Useful Scripts

I made some simple but yet powerful scripts to speed up the workflow:

- [`getSrc.py`](./utils/getSrc.py):  
  üîç **Auto-Generate Source Lists for Makefiles**  
  Recursively scans your project directory for `*.c` and `*_bonus.c` files, then writes them into convenient `SRC` and `SRC_BONUS` lists for your Makefile. Supports excluding directories, custom extensions, and output file naming!

- [`proToC.py`](./utils/proToC.py):  
  üßô **Prototype-to-Source Magic**  
  Feed it a header file, and it will generate `.c` files with skeleton implementations for every function prototype found inside!

- [`grabProtos.py`](./utils/grabProtos.py):  
  üéØ **Extract Function Prototypes**  
  Scans your C source files and extracts all function prototypes, perfect for creating header files! Supports filtering static functions, excluding directories, and custom formatting.

Feel free to check out the scripts in the [`utils`](./utils/) folder for more workflow-boosting tools!

### ‚öôÔ∏è VSCode Settings

I've rearranged some useful settings for making the user experience a little better on C projects in vscode.

All you need to do is to copy the [`.vscode`](.vscode) folder into your project.
